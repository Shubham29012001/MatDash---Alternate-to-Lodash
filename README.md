# MatDash-Alternate-to-Lodash

Following are the sets to call the library: -

1) Open up the console and directly use the library with _.[function_name] (without chaining)
2) Call getInputfromConsole('Custom_Library_Name') to set the library name in the console
3) Call the library with chain function to make it chainable.
4) Call any custom functions that returns the value of the complete chain function
